- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe-Andre!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much Swift as i can by collaborating and working on different projects. I am 59 days into learning how to code in swift. I'd love to meet other people that are also starting to learn, and I'd also love to meet people experienced in this field
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift for mobile developement in IOS. Im currently 59 days in, so i know a little about the basics and Ive started basic projects on my own with tutorials
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Swift related. Pretty much anything to get my hands dirty and truly know how to work with a team!
