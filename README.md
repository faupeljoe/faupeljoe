- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe-Andre!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my skills as an IOS Developer. I wouldn't consider myself a profession just yet, but i'd love to reach that point by working with a team and challenging myself!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a couple of different projects. These projects contain API's, UserDefaults, Notifications, StoryBoard, Cocoapods, and more! I taught myself to be consistent as I was working on my code for at least an hour a day for more than 100 days in a row. I'm also trying to contribute to other's projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Swift related. I would love to attain a position as a Junior IOS Developer so that I can get my hands dirty and truly know how to work with a team!
- 📫 You can reach me by email: faupeljoe@gmail.com OR by twitter: @faupeljoe
- Feel free to check out my current projects!
