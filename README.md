- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe-Andre!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my skills as an IOS Developer. I wouldn't consider myself a profession just yet, but i'd love to reach that point by working with a team and challenging myself!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a couple of different projects. I was consistent with coding in swift every day for 100+ days in a row.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Swift related. I would love to attain a position as a junior IOS developer so that I can get my hands dirty and truly know how to work with a team!
- 📫 You can reach me by email: faupeljoe@gmail.com OR by twitter: @faupeljoe
